YumReleaseProtection
====================

It offers the ability to add package priority based off the Release of a package for installs and updates/upgrades. It eases automatic upgrades for RPM system admins who have rebuilt their own packages and don't want to upgrade them just because a newer version is out. And helps them install packages so yum won't install the highest version but their release of the package instead. Also adds options to disable the feature and specify the release string to look for.
